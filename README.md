# Swift x Metal for 3D Graphics Rendering

This repository contains the project I created whist using **Swift (with SwiftUI)** and **Metal** to create simple 3D graphics on Apple platforms. 
It's part of an ongoing article series in which I explore the fundamentals needed to create a 3D Rendering Pipeline in Swift.

> **Author’s Note:** If I've made any errors, or you have a really cool way of implementing something, feel free to open an issue or leave a comment!
